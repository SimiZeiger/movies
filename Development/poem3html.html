   <h1>Acquainted with the Night</h1> 
<h4>BY <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/robert-frost">ROBERT FROST</a></h4>
<p>
    <div>I have been one acquainted with the night.<br>
    I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.<br>
    I have outwalked the furthest city light.</div>   
</p>
<p>
    <div>I have been one acquainted with the night.<br>
    I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.<br>
    I have outwalked the furthest city light.</div>
    </p>
<p>
   <div> I have looked down the saddest city lane.<br>
I have passed by the watchman on his beat<br>
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.</div>
</p>
<p>
<div>I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet<br>
When far away an interrupted cry<br>
Came over houses from another street,</div>
</p>
<p>
<div>But not to call me back or say good-bye;<br>
And further still at an unearthly height,<br>
One luminary clock against the sky</div>
</p>
<p>
<div>Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.<br> 
I have been one acquainted with the night.</div>
