            <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1> 
            <h2>BY ROBERT FROST</h2>
<p>
    <div>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, <br>
        And sorry I could not travel both <br>
        And be one traveler, long I stood <br>
        And looked down one as far as I could <br>
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;</div>
     </p>
<p>
     <div>Then took the other, as just as fair, <br>
                And having perhaps the better claim, <br>
                Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br>
                Though as for that the passing there <br>
                Had worn them really about the same,</div>
        </p>
<p>
    <div>And both that morning equally lay
                    In leaves no step had trodden black. <br>
                    Oh, I kept the first for another day! <br>
                    Yet knowing how way leads on to way, <br>
                    I doubted if I should ever come back.</div>
        <p/>
<p>
    <div>I shall be telling this with a sigh
                        Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br>
                        Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” <br>
                        I took the one less traveled by, <br>
                        And that has made all the difference.</div>
